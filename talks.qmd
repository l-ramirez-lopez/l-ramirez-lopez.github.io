An important part of my work involves sharing knowledge and supporting capacity building in data analytics, machine learning, and spectroscopy. Over the years, I have led and contributed to workshops, training courses, and talks for researchers, students, and professionals across academia, government, and industry.

Below are selected talks and training activities.

### __From decision to impact: successfully starting with NIR__ *(in Spanish)*  
**Invited talk**  
*World Food Organization (FAO)*  
*Online, 25 September 2025*  
Public talk on translating near-infrared spectroscopy from decision-making to operational impact.
