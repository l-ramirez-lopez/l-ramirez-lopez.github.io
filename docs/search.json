I completed my doctoral studies at University of Tübingen (Germany), carried out postdoctoral research at ETH (Switzerland), and more recently undertook further study at Imperial College London (UK), completing a Master’s in Business Analytics. I have also lived and worked in several countries, including Colombia, Brazil, Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland.\nHave a look at this post, where I discuss why business education is important for scientists."
