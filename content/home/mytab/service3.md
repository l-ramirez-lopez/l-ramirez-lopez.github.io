Since 2015 I am developing innovative data analytics solutions of Near-Infrared 
(NIR) sensing devices which are usually used in the agrifood sector...

I my day-to-day work I deal with large amounts of data coming from different 
agricultural products. I work specifically with the application of NIR 
sensing technology in the quantification of different quality parameters 
of multiple agricultural and environmental  products (e.g. soil, raw material 
for feed, food, etc).
NIR data represents quantitative measurements of the amount light that these 
products absorb at 
thousands of different wavelengths in the NIR region of the electromagnetic 
spectrum. This data NIR can be translated into meaningful information that 
describe the properties of a given sample (e.g. protein content, moisture 
content, fat content, etc) from a given product. This is done by building 
predictive models using signal processing and machine learning techniques due 
to the fact that NIR data is complex. To build these models I use state of the 
art machine learning methods (e.g. memory-based learning, artificial neural 
networks, rule-based learning, etc).
